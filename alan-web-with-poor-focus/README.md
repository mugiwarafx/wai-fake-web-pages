# Web with poor focus - Alan's video

## Description 

From previous (Web form with button); page includes address submission fields. Focus jumps through fields sequentially. Moving from last field from to next field needs to be strange. Alternatively, fields could be for payment and deliver address and skip between the two as they are presented in two columns.
